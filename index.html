        <p class = 'first-p'>In this page you are going to learn a little about my running journey.
           When I first started running I was running about a <span>15 minute mile</span>
           as time progressed that got lower to my current <span>6:41 minute mile</span> 
        </p>
        <p>There is another marathon coming up in march that I think I will be going for. 
            I want to see how well I will do injury free this time around. I believe I can 
            finish the marathon this time around at <span class = 'future-time'>4hrs:20minute time</span> frame 
            compared to my current finisher time <span class = 'current-time'>6hr:33min:03sec</span>. I just 
            don't want to pay the registeration fee for the race which is <span>$199</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Current best times:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 mile: 6:41</li>
