<h1>Hello This is going to be Raul's portofio site</h1>
<p> I have wanted to create a portofio site for so long to showcase sites I have created(none at the moment but half way done with one which will
be a full stack application) One of the things I personally find difficult in creating a portofio is the design of the site. I have spent hours 
looking for a site design to create for my own website. But by the end of this sesemester I will have my portofio completed. </p>
<p> I recommend anyone going into the tech field to create their own personal portofio to showcase their work as well. I also choose a theme on 
the github pages tab which added some files if you are wondering why I have extra file. Got them because the site to the site was originally not 
working so I wanted to see if that would somehow fix the issue. It did not by the way. will figure out how to remove the files by sat 1/22 </p>
